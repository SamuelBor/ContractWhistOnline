# A Web Platform for the Comparison of Strategies in a Trick-Based Card Game

CS310 Dissertation Project - A Web Application for Contract Whist

## Motivation

Contract Whist was first introduced to me by my father when I was around 10 years old,  and it was inturn introduced to him around 20 years earlier by a close friend of his.  It is a trick-based card game witha bidding aspect similar to that of the more widespread game:  Bridge.

After many years of being evenly matched at the game with other members of my family, I took a great interest in researching different game strategies that could yield advantage over one anotherafter being simulated in-game a large number of times. While we had often theorised that a winning strategy existed, until now we had no way to test one against another. This project aims to resolve this dispute; a dispute that spans the best part of a decade.

Through many hours of research, I discovered that there exist very few other investigations into this specific whist variant.  Previous projects that I did find focused either exclusively on strategy research or on simulating gameplay, but none were found that explore both. Therefore, to be able to create a fully functioning game environment that agents can interact with - in the same capacity as humans can - while also investigating gameplay strategies, is a very exciting prospect.
